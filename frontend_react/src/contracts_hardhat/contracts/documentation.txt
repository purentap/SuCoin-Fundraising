For Admins:
Step needed to deploy contracts for sulaunch project
You can use admin panel (if it is finished) or remix / hardhat
1. Deploy ProjectRegister contract with your wanted threshold value
2. If wanted give admin permissions to others using grantRole function or give whitelist / blacklist using editUserStatus function
3. Except Auction.sol and CappedTokenAuction.sol (they are non deployable) deploy your wanted auction type contracts
4. Create new or get current sucoin contract from supayment
5. Create maestro contract entering sucoin address, projectregister address, two arrays auction type name - auction address pair

For Starting an auction:
Frontend is preferred
1. Create a project
2. Wait for whitelisted users to vote on it
3. If they reject the project try creating another Owner
4. If project is approved create a project token
5. After creating a project token select an auction type and create it with your desired parameters
6. When you want to start the auction call StartAuction with your desired duration
7. If Auction is not ended even if duration ended call manualFinish

For bidding:
Frontend is preferred
1. Enter a running auction 
2. Enter how much sucoin you want to invest but don't forget to look at current price
3. If auction is non orderbook type you will  get your tokens instantly so no need to wait the auction
4. If auction is orderbook after you bid (below limit )you will get your tokens or your sucoins will be refunded after auction finalizes
